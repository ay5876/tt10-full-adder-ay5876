## How it works
A full adder is a combinational circuit that adds two bits and a
carry and outputs a sum bit and a carry bit. When we want to add
two binary numbers, each having two or more bits,the LSBs can be
added by using a half adder.

## How to test
You test it by running all possible inputs and checking if the
outputs match the expected values. Refer to the truth table of
full adder below.


| A | B | Cin | Sum | Cout |
|---|---|-----|-----|------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
